## Coding Rules

### Adding New Files to the project

-   Make sure that new files are placed in the file system in the same
    directory that matches the group in which you placed the file in the Xcode
    Project Navigator.

-   Make sure that new files are sorted correctly inside their group in the
    Xcode Project Navigator. This can easily be achieved after adding new files
    to the project by selecting all of the files in the group, and running
    `"Edit" -> "Sort" -> "By Name"`
